# Recovero website Clone

Welcome to the homepage clone of Recovero.


## Description

This project is a clone of the homepage of Recovero. It replicates the design of the original website's homepage.

- In navbar I tried to make the nearest clone of the navbar present in website
- I have also fixed the position of navbar to fixed as mentioned in the assignment.

- In every section of the website I followed minor details to clone it.

- I have made webpage responsive for both mobile and desktop devices

- For positioning of any elements in webpage I have used flex box, because it is the most convinient and better way to give positioning.

- For font I have used font closer to the orignal font family

- I have used both px , vw and vh unit for giving the dimensions.

- I have used all the same colours as in orignal website
